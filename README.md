# gowalk
messing with apple healthkit to simulate walking

# plan

- promisify `AppleHealthKit.initHealthKit` and `AppleHealthKit.saveSteps`
- follow https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/customizing/ to finish setting up dev flow

- background tasks are out (not easily possible)
- instead we will capture a start time and store in a local db
- render a timer that shows distance walked
- periodically (when app is open) write out steps / healthkit activity

- app user flow
  - open app, select egg, adjust distance if necessary (e.g. 2.3/10km)
  - backwards calculate time to walk remaining distance i.e. ~7.7km
  - create timer displaying walk progress, animated bar or something
  - setup a future notification to alert phone/user when finished walking
  - while app is active, periodically log walking activity in 1-10 min intervals or something

# seems like we might need to upgrade Xcode which requires updated OSX to 12 ...
# going to do that...

# looks like we will want to follow this guide for setting up custom native code
# it first has us use expo run:ios like above to build the project
# then it guides us through using expo-dev-client (to go back to fast JS fast refresh workflow)
# and then finally using eas build to create builds that run on devices
# https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/customizing/

expo run:ios
# 🎉 working!!
# all good after updating to macOS 12.4 & Xcode 13.4.1
